in order to run these scripts, it will be necessary to have cv2, numpy, and imutils.object_detection, as these libraries are utilised in this project


detect.py is used to apply pedestrian detection on still images, wherein all sample images have been obtained from Google
detect was based off of tutorial found at https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/09/pedestrian-detection-opencv/


video_detect.py is used to apply pedestrian detection over a live camera, which could feasibly then be used for other applications
applying webcam steps was based on basic instruction provided in tutorials and at https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html
